    <h1>Snow The Dog</h1>
    <p>Snow is a one of a kind dog. I love dogs because Dogs are devoted, compassionate, cuddly, and adorable. They can, however, be so much more. They can be lifesavers, heroes, nurturers, and self-esteem boosters. They can be smartypants and bully-busters, not to mention the best mothers on the planet. If you probably dont own a dog by now, i should warn you this blog might just make you change your mind. </p>
    <p>Snow likes to play various games including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>hide and seek</li>
        <li>Tug-of-war</li>
        <li>Puzzle toys</li>
        <li>Search and sniff</li>
        <li> Movie night</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Snow is a rare breed <img src="./images/valerie-elash-mTJSiAeb4jQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="Snow" width="200px"></p>
