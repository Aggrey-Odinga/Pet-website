        <p>Petfinder is a searchable online database of animals in need of homes. It also includes a directory of nearly
            11,000 animal shelters and adoption organizations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Organizations
            have their own home pages and pet-availability databases.

            Our goal is to
            To make use of Internet technology and the resources it can generate in order to:

            Raising public awareness about the availability of high-quality adoptable pets.
            Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across North America to the point where
            adoptable pets are no longer euthanized.
            Pets should be treated as family members.
            Pet owners can search for a pet that best suits their needs from the comfort of their own homes. They can
            then go to a shelter's website to find out what services are available.</p>
